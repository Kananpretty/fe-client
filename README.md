# Functionality

All the available sensors from the backend websocket will be displayed on the screen.

By default they will be not connected, and when you click on the Connect Button, the sensor will be connected and live values will be shown on the screen of that particular sensor.

Once the live values are displaying in real time from the backend server, we can stop it by clicking on the disconnect button.

We also have a filter which we either show the connected sensors or all the sensors.
